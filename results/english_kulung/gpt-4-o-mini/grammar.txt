"To help with the translation, here is a grammar book for the Kulung language. \nINTRODUCTION\n5\npublications on Kulung include a short treatise on Kulung phonology\nby Andreas Holzhausen (1973) and a short paper on Kulung clauses\nby his wife Anna Holzhausen (1973).\n1.1.2 The Kiranti languages\nTogether with Limbu, the R\u00e3i languages belong to the Kiranti branch\nof the Tibeto-Burman language family. The Kiranti languages are\ncharacterised by their elaborate system of verbal endings, which are\nsaid to have been the result of a historical process traditionally called\n'complex pronominalisation', i.e. the incorporation of personal pro-\nnouns into the verbal chain.\nBauman (1975), however, argues for the reconstruction of verbal\nmorphology at a Proto-Tibeto-Burman level, rather than for the incor-\nporation of pronouns into the verbal system. George van Driem\n(1990, 1993c) has further developed this hypothesis, and more recent\npublications describing Tibeto-Burman languages would seem to con-\nfirm the reconstruction of verbal morphology at the Proto-Tibeto-\nBurman level.\nThe Kiranti languages are also characterised by their archaic pho-\nnologies. Phonological systems of modern Kiranti languages often\nresemble reconstructed Old Chinese, without tones and with distinc-\ntive vowel length (Baxter 1992, 1995), far more than the innovative\nphonological systems of present-day Lolo-Burmese languages do,\nwith their complex tonal systems. Kulung is classified by van Driem\n(2001: 698) as a Central Kiranti language.\n1.2 The people\nThe Kulung are a people of Mongoloid stock practising sedentary\nagriculture and animal husbandry. The major crops are potatoes,\nmaize and especially millet, from which a hard, thick brown paste,\ncalled yuwa, is prepared and which forms the mainstay of the diet.\nRice is not cultivated by the Kulung. The millet paste is supplemented\nwith khai 'cooked vegetables' or ground soybeans. Meat is usually\nonly eaten on ritual occasions. Pork, boksa, is preferred to other meat,\na preference that is shared by many other Tibeto-Burman peoples. As\nwith some other R\u00e3i peoples, the eating of goat meat is forbidden. The\n6\nCHAPTER ONE\nKulung are proud of drinking a lot of alcohol. In their eating and\ndrinking habits, the Kulung are quite different from the higher caste\nHindus in Nepal, who do not drink any alcohol and who eat castrated\ngoat in preference to other meat. Lower castes living in Kulung vil-\nlages, such as K\u00e4m\u012b blacksmiths and the Dam\u00e4\u00efm tailors, have largely\nadopted the Kulung way of life in as much as they drink alcohol and\neat pork.\n1.2.1 Clans\nAccording to the oral tradition of the Kulung, their ancestor, k\"\u0259p, had\ntwo sons, chemsi and tamsi. As a result, Kulung society is divided into\ntwo lineages; one descending from chemsi, and the other from the\noffspring of tamsi. In the village of Chemsin, the majority of clans\nbelong to the chemsi lineage, while in villages further downstream,\nclans descending from the c\"emsi lineage tend to be in the minority.\nThe major clans of the the chemsi lineage are tomoc\"a, walak\"am,\nwadiri and moro:ku, while the dominant clans deriving descent from\nthe tamsi lineage are rinho, mant\"erbu and honelu.\nEvery clan has a secret name, dapsni\u014b, in the ritual language of the\nKulung, which is known as sak\"umbu. The secret names of the clans\nare used during the recitation of ritual texts by the shaman at wedding\nceremonies to welcome and honour participants. The secret names of\nthe important tomoc\"a clan is sambelutupsima titilumolema.\n1.2.2 Mythology\nThe mythological stories told by the Kulung concerning the origin of\nthe world and about their ancestors are part of the common R\u00e3i my-\nthology. In his anthropological study (1991), Martin Gaenszle de-\nscribed how Kiranti mythology is interwoven with the kinship system.\nKulung equivalents of the common R\u00e3\u00ee names of gods and heroes are\ngiven in Table 2.\nAccording to the Kulung people, their ancestors settled in the Hun-\ngu valley some thirty-five generations ago. The Kulung elders told me\nthat their ancestors came from the Tar\u00e3\u00ee. When the Kulung ancestors\nsettled in the Hungu valley, they waged war against the local people\nwho were savages, referred to as rupiyo\u014bcha or co:dos by the Kulung.\nKULUNG\nninam ridum\nk'okcilikpa\nparu\nThe story about how the rupiyo\u014bc\"a were defeated by the Kulung is\nwell-described by McDougal (1979: 17-19). The rupiyoncha however,\nare called rungsiupa by McDougal, and the ladder by which the\nrupiyoncha tried to escape to the sun was made from buckwheat ac-\ncording to my informants and not from millet, as it is in McDougal's\naccount. Apart from the story, which is quite humorous in parts, the\ndate of the first settlement of the Kulung in the Hungu valley and the\nidentification of the Nepal lowlands as their place of origin may not\nbe entirely fictitious. Equally interesting in this respect is the fact that\nNepalis are nowadays referred to as t'aru in the Kulung language, and\nthat th\u0101ru in Nepali is the name of an Indo-Aryan people living along\nthe length and breadth of the Tarai.\nINTRODUCTION\nruwo\n1.2.3 Ritual tradition\nDUMI\nnina:mbi\nk'opsilikpa\nMEWAHANG\npari\nsimnim\nruwabhu\nTable 2: Kulung equivalents of R\u00e4\u00ef names of gods and heroes\nninamma ridum\nk\"akculukpa\nparuha\u014b\nsomnima\n7\ndeprive\nRites in Kulung society are always performed by a shaman, priest or\nelder, who chants ritual texts in the ritual language. This ritual lan-\nguage is used in the same way as Sanskrit is used in contemporary\nHindu rituals. In briefly describing the main rituals performed at the\ntime of my visits in Chesk\u0101m, I hope to give the reader some idea of\nhow these rituals are performed. Further details and a discussion of\nthe actual rituals can be found in MacDougal (1979) and in Gaenszle\n(1991). Some words from the Kulung ritual language are given below,\nalong with their corresponding Kulung and English meanings.\nDuring the tos ritual, which is performed three times a year, the\ndeceased relatives of the Kulung are called upon to promote the\ngrowth of crops. The names of the three tos rituals are yenamtos, per-\nformed in June, t'o:tos, which is held in September, and yautos, which\n8\ntakes places in March. People gather on a hill in the village, beating\ncymbals and blowing horns. The priest, who is called a nokc\"o, pours\nritual millet beer on a stone that is placed in a hole in the ground.\nPeople dance around the hole playing cymbals. After a while, the\npriest also starts to dance. The purpose of the beating of the cymbals\nand the blowing of horns is to invoke the ancestors. After the ritual is\nfinished, the Kulung drink wheat beer during yenamtos, maize beer\nduring tho:tos, and millet beer at yautos. The ritual is performed twice,\nonce at the foot of the hill for the descendants of chemsi, and once on\ntop of the hill for the descendants of tamsi.\nRITUAL LANGUAGE\nbarama\ngodilin\nhadima\nCHAPTER ONE\nk\"ebalukunisa\nmikwadam\npowama\np'unma\nsamdam\ntokosija\nKULUNG\nmeis\nluis\nENGLISH\nwater-buffalo\nsheep\nCOW\ndog\nsalt\npi\nk\"eb\nrum\nwar\nsi\u014b\nk'orsai\nkhobop\nTable 3: Words from the Kulung ritual language\nchicken\nfirewood\nchilli, red pepper\nmaize\nAnother ritual of particular importance is the nagi ritual The ritual\nis named after nagi, a pan-R\u00e3i god who is visualised as a water ser-\npent and who lives in the river. The deity nagi is said to live in the\nmountains during the summer, and in the valleys during winter. When\nnagi is in the valley, extra care must be taken not to offend nagi in\nany way.\nImportant occasions in the life of the members of a household are\ncelebrated with a ritual that is performed by a mo:bocha 'shaman'.\nDuring this ritual, called a mo:bo, a pig or a chicken is sacrificed. An\naltar is usually present at this ritual, in the form of a house made of\nleaves and branches, where various ritual artifacts are placed, such as\nsmall ships made of leaves.\nINTRODUCTION\n9\nHousehold gods are worshipped in a ritual called daplo kuima. The\nname of the ritual is based on the words daplo 'hearth' and kuima \u2018to\nlibate', referring to the main event of the ceremony in which a shaman\nlibates the three hearth stones with millet beer. The three hearth\nstones are called pak\"alun, sambelun and mak\"olun. The ritual cere-\nmony is attended by all the members of the household along with\ntheir close relatives.\n1.3 The grammar\nThe present grammar is based on research conducted in the village of\nChesk\u0101m, which, with an estimated population of 3,000, is one of the\nlarger Kulung villages. An initial short visit in October 1992 was fol-\nlowed by longer stays in the summer of 1993 and spring of 1994. A\nfinal visit was made in November 1995. During my stays at Chesk\u0101m,\nI had the pleasure of being the live-in guest of Ratna R\u0101m Rai (born\n1967 AD), his wife Main\u0101 Ma\u0146\u012b (born 1968 AD), and their two\ndaughters Durg\u0101 M\u0101y\u0101 (born 1987 AD) and \u015aukre M\u0101y\u0101 (born 1990\nAD). Many of the examples in the grammar are taken from their con-\nversations and form the basis for my understanding of the Kulung\nlanguage. Words are given in a transcription which uses the symbols\nof the International Phonetic Association (IPA 1993). The transcrip-\ntion is phonological, but words that are subject to final vowel deletion\n(see 2.4.2) are given in their phonetic representation.\nWIN\n2.1 Vowels\nVowel phonemes are described in terms of their distinctive features,\ni.e. height, backness, rounding and length.

A word may\nkeep its final vowel when uttered in isolation, e.g. in eliciting vocabu-\nlary, but drops the final vowel when the word is followed by an affix.\nIf, for example, someone, pointing at his eye, asks how to say 'eye' in\nKulung, a Kulung will give the answer: muksi 'eye'. When followed\nby a case such as the locative, the Kulung word is muks-pi eye-LOC\n'in the eye' and not *muksi-pi.\n70\n71\n72\nan\nyous\nmisi\nperson\n'You are a person.'\nPHONOLOGY\nmis-mi\nperson-GEN foot\nlo\u014b chur-e\nbe-nls\n'A person has feet.'\nn\u0259wa\nhere\nkawa\nwater\n'Here [take], water!'\nkau-pi\nwater-LOC\nk\"at-e-yo\ngo-nls-Q\n'Are you going for water?\"\n21\nThe supine morpheme <-si> in sentence (73) has retained its full form\nbecause the morpheme occurs in sentence-final position.\n22\n73\ne\nhey\nc\"e-si\npiss-SUP\n74\nCHAPTER TWO\nbo:-?a\nuncle-VOC\nc\u00b9e-s\npiss-SUP\nharro-i\nwhither-Q\n'Hey, uncle, where are you going to?'\n'[I am going] to piss'\nIn example (74), the supine is followed by a finite verb and thus the\nfinal vowel of the supine suffix is dropped.\nkhat-e\ngo-nls\nk'at-o:\ngo-1s.NPT\n'I am going to piss.'\nThe allophony of other suffixes that show final vowel deletion, e.g.\nthe active participle <-pa> and the infinitive suffix <-ma> is treated in\nthe relevant chapters. The words /c\u00b9uli/ \u2018anger', /walili/ \u2018lie', /\u014bali/\n'beauty' are anomalous in retaining the final vowel in non-final posi-\ntion, e.g. c'uli-?a 'by [his] anger' and not *c'ul-?a. If, however, vowel\ndeletion would lead to a phonologically impossible sequence of stops,\nthen the vowel deletion rule is blocked. The noun kokpa \u2018uncle', for\nexample, has the genitive kokpa-mi 'of the uncle', and not *kokp-mi.\n3.1 Number\nTo the nominal categories belong the following parts of speech:\nnouns, adjectives, pronouns and numerals. There are unambiguous\nmorphological criteria for distinguishing between nouns and verbs.\nWhereas nouns can be marked for case and number, finite verbs are\nmarked for person, number, and tense.
