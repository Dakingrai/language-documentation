Although the Nepali numeral system is widely used in Kulung, I was
able to collect the indigenous numerals from 1 to 10. Numerals have
classifier suffixes attached to the numeral stem. When counting hu-
man referents, the classifier <-po> is added to the numeral stem. For
non-human referents, the classifier <-bou> is found. In the next table,
the numerals from 1 to 10 are presented.

3.5 Adjectives
Unlike some Tibeto-Burman languages such as Chinese or Lahu,
which express adjectival concepts through intransitive verbs, Kulung
possesses parts of speech which may be called adjectives. Adjectives
differ from nouns by virtue of their inability to take case endings. In
Kulung adjectives precede the noun they belong to and can be modi-
fied by adverbs which precede them.
NON-HUMAN
REFERENT
3.5.1 Colour adjectives
Colour terms are expressed by adjectives. The term gigippa covers a
range on the colour spectrum from 'green' to 'purple'. Moreover, the
term for 'yellow' is derived from besar, the Nepali word for 'tur-
meric'.

154
3.5.2 Intensive
The intensive suffix <-yo> (INT) can be added to the adjective stem to
emphasise the intensity of the quality the adjective expresses. From
the adjective lemlempa 'sweet', for example, an intensive form
lemlem-yo 'very sweet' can be derived. In the process, note that the
suffix <-pa> is dropped. The adjective gugur-yo 'pitch-black' in ex-
ample (154) is the intensive form of the adjective gugurpa 'black'.

3.5.3 The diminutive particle <-c"a>
The diminutive particle (DIM) <-cha> is a productive morpheme in
Kulung, which can be added to nouns and adjectives. Added to nouns,
the diminutive particle indicates the small physical size of the object.
For example, bo: 'pig' vs. bok-cha (pig-DIM) 'piglet', k'im 'house' vs.
khim-cha (house-DIM) ‘little house', hu ‘hand' vs. hu-cha 'little hand',
luŋ 'stone' vs. luŋ-c"a ‘small stone', etc. In some cases, the diminu-
tive particle is found affixed to adjectives.
ci:ma-cha
small-DIM
ku:o-cha
well-DIM
'a tiny well'
khat-a
go-PT

Moreover, the diminutive particle is found with the meaning ‘only,
just'.
oci-halla-cha
ourdi-alone-DIM
'only wedi alone'
42
157
158

As in Dumi (van Driem 1993a: 79), in Kulung too the diminutive
suffix <-cha> can be added to adverbs making the meaning of the ad-
verb less intense.

VERB STEM MORPHOLOGY
The majority of Kulung verbs are monosyllabic. Polysyllabic verbs
are verbs which consist of a preverb and a verb stem. All affixes are
suffixed to the verb stem with the exception of the negative preterite
morpheme <man->, which appears before the verb stem with some
polysyllabic verbs, but is found before the preverb with other polysyl-
labic verbs. The polysyllabic verb lam dumma 'to walk, stroll', for
example, has a first person singular negated non-preterite form lam
dum-o:-no 'I don't walk' and a first person singular negated preterite
form lam man-dum-ŋa ‘I didn't walk'. Polysyllabic verbs with the
negative preterite morpheme <man-> appearing before the verb stem
are listed below.

cham lama
hachi lama
sil bama
to remma
nap
chuma
'to walk, stroll'
'to sing'
'to sneeze'
'to dance'
'to stand'
'to stink'
Polysyllabic verbs with the negative preterite morpheme <man->
found before the preverb belong to a small class of verbs of motion.
For example, the affirmative non-preterite of the polysyllabic verb
ta-m-tho:-ma 'to arrive up here' is ta t'oŋ-o: 'I arrive up here'. The
corresponding negated preterite form man-ta-n tho:-ŋa ‘I didn't arrive
up here'. Furthermore, the first syllable of the prefixed verb receives
the 'compound verb marker’ <-n> (CM) in the negated preterite tense
and adds an extra infinitive morpheme <-m-> after the preverb in the
infinitive. The prefixed compound verbs form a small, closed class of
verbs. For convenience all the verbs of this class are listed here.

165

167
In order to distinguish between the two groups of polysyllabic verbs, I
have decided to write the polysyllabic verbs with the negative prete-
rite morpheme <man-> before the preverb as a single word.
