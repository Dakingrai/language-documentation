Case endings are attached to nouns with or without the non-singular
suffix and convey meanings like ‘the place where', 'possession', etc.
Allomorphy of case endings depends on whether the noun ends in a
vowel or a consonant. In the next table, the case endings of the nouns
na 'elder sister' and lam 'road' are presented.

The word misi 'man' has an anomalous and irregular ergative ending,
i.e. mic-a 'man-ERG'.

3.2.1 The ergative
The ergative case (ERG) marks the agent of a transitive verb. The er-
gative case is marked by the suffix <-?a>, but personal pronouns and
interrogative pronouns take the allomorph <-a>, which is also the
allomorph found after the non-singular suffix <-ci ~ -c~ -s> (ns).
Demonstratives used as third person pronouns have the allomorph
<-sa>.

verbs appear in the absolutive case.

Predicates with three arguments (agent, patient and indirect object),
like pima 'to give', are constructed with the agent appearing in the
ergative, and both the patient and indirect object in the absolutive,
though the verb shows agreement with the patient. In sentence (95)
below, the arguments an 'you' and di 'millet beer' are in the unmark-
ed absolutive, whereas kon-a 'I', the agent of the transitive verb 'to
give', appears in the ergative marked here with the suffix <-a>.

action or situation described by the verb.

'My skin has been peeled by the sunshine.'
The instrumental <-?a> is identical in form with the ergative, but be-
haves differently at the morphosyntactic level. A verb in Kulung
shows agreement with the agent or patient, but never with an argu-
ment in the instrumental. In example (98), the verb coi-o: shows
agreement with a first person agent and third person patient. If the
morpheme <-?a> in or-hu-?a were to be an ergative, then the correct
verb would have been *cəi-ə, and the meaning of the sentence would
have been **My hand eats it'.

The ablative is also found in some idiomatic expressions. The verb
tumma 'to meet' governs the ablative with the meaning to meet
someone, i.e. to gather at a particular place'. In the following sen-
tence, the ablative is affixed to a nominalised verbal form.

The elative, consisting of one of the four locatives <-pi>, <-pa>,
<-pu>, or <-pto> followed by the ablative <-pka>, conveys the mean-
34
ing ‘from out of'. The difference in sense between a Kulung ablative
and elative is lost in the English rendering, cf. (126) vs. (129).

A suffix <-yika> 'since' is found with temporal adverbs like espa
'yesterday' or desa 'tomorrow'. Historically, this suffix probably con-
sists of an unattested locative <-yi> which is cognate to the Dumi
locative in temporal sense <-yi> (van Driem 1993a: 71) and the allo-
morph <-ka> of the ablative suffix <-pka>.
