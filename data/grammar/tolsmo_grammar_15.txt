Often the infinitive is used as a nomen actionis. The infinitive of
ne:ma 'to speak' may have the meaning '[way of] speaking', Nepali
bolī. Likewise the term for 'love' is mima ‘love', the infinitive of 'to
think'. The infinitive may further serve as a circumlocution for ob-
samoglasnione z man ta

jects only recently introduced in Kulung culture for which no native
word is available. Example (528) can be used to refer to a lighter.

9.6 The supine
529
530
The supine <-si> may be added to the infinitive stem of verbs ex-
pressing motion such as k'aima 'to go', baima 'to come', porma 'to
wake up', giving the meaning 'in order to'. The morpheme <-si>
drops its vowel in non-final position (cf. 2.4.2). This morpheme is
cognate with the supine <-se> in Limbu (van Driem 1986: 212).

9.7 The impersonal first plural inclusive
The use of the first person inclusive forms in impersonal verbal con-
structions is a characteristic of probably all Kiranti languages (cf. van
Driem 1987: 218-221, 1993: 275).

Subordinators are morphologically and semantically closely related to
case markers (cf. Genetti 1986). Subordinators may be attached to a
finite clause in both preterite and non-preterite tense.
542
10.1 The temporal subordinator <-lo>
The suffix <-lo> 'whilst, when' (Nep. -kheri) may be added to any
affirmative or negative, non-preterite or preterite finite form, with or
without the subordinating suffix <-ko>, to denote that the action of the
main verb is contemporaneous with the verb in the main clause. Un-
like the present gerund <-to>, the finite form to which the suffix <-lo>
is added may have a different referent than the referent of the main
clause. Historically, the suffix is related to the comitative case ending
<-lo>.

10.2 The temporal subordinator <-pka>
The ablative case-marker <-pka>, preceded by the general subordina-
tor <-kə>, functions as a temporal subordinator to express anteriority
of the action of the main verb in the sentence. The temporal subordi-
nator <-pka> is semantically identical with the perfect gerund <-na>.

Three modal categories are found in Kulung. These are imperative,
optative and irrealis.
566
11.1 The imperative
Imperatives in Kulung are made with the aid of one of the suffixes
<-wa>, <-te> or <-kon>. Of these imperative suffixes, the suffix
<-wa> is slightly more polite than the suffix <-te>. In addressing a
superior, e.g. one's father, it is more common to use the imperative
suffix <-wo>. The imperative suffix <-kon> differs from the suffixes
<-wa> and <-te>, in that the imperative suffix <-khon> is used to ex-
press additional impatience and the desired immediate realisation of
the order issued.
