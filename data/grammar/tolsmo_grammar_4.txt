2.3.1 Allophonic variation
Before the fricative /s/ and a following consonant, the voiceless un-
aspirated bilabial stop /p/ and the voiceless unaspirated dorso-velar
stop /k/ become a voiceless bilabial fricative [] and a voiceless
dorso-velar fricative [x], respectively.

The affricates as well as the phonemes /?/ and /h/ do not occur in syl-
lable-final and word-final position. The only three stops that occur in
syllable-final and word-final position, i.e. the voiceless unaspirated
bilabial stop /p/, the voiceless unaspirated apico-dental stop /t/, and
the voiceless unaspirated dorso-velar stop /k/ are pronounced unrel-
eased, e.g.
W

/se:r/

The voiced bilabial nasal /m/ becomes a voiceless bilabial nasal [m] if
followed by the fricative /s/ and a following consonant.
[imstsai]
'He is sleeping.'

2.4 Suprasegmental phonology
2.4.1 The syllable
A Kulung syllable may consist of a single vowel or nasal.
[n.kə]
'he, she, it'
[m.pa]
'his father'
[e]
'yes'
67
/ŋ.kə/
/m.pa/
/e/
If a syllable has the structure CV, the vowel can be a short vowel, a
long vowel or a diphthong.
68
/sa/
/bo:/
/poi/
CHAPTER TWO
[ja]
[wa]
[fia]
[Pa]
/loŋ/
/lam/
A Kulung syllable can have the structure CVC. The affricates and the
phonemes /?/ and /h/ do not occur in syllable-final position.
/muks.pi/
/chelm.lo/
[sa]
[bo:]
[poi]
'edge of a blade'
'rain'
'AFF'
'ERG'
[lɔŋ]
[lam]
'meat'
'pig'
'neck'
Syllables having the structure CVCC result from final vowel deletion
(2.4.2).
[muxspi]
[tshelmlɔ]
'foot'
'road'
'in the eye'
'with a bamboo mat'
69
2.4.2 Vowel deletion
In Kulung, there is a general rule which states that polysyllabic nouns,
adjectives, and verbal affixes that end in /-pa/, /-ma/, /-wa/ or /-i/ drop
their final vowel in other than sentence-final position. A word may
keep its final vowel when uttered in isolation, e.g. in eliciting vocabu-
lary, but drops the final vowel when the word is followed by an affix.
If, for example, someone, pointing at his eye, asks how to say 'eye' in
Kulung, a Kulung will give the answer: muksi 'eye'. When followed
by a case such as the locative, the Kulung word is muks-pi eye-LOC
'in the eye' and not *muksi-pi.

The supine morpheme <-si> in sentence (73) has retained its full form
because the morpheme occurs in sentence-final position.

e
hey
c"e-si
piss-SUP
74
CHAPTER TWO
bo:-?a
uncle-VOC
c¹e-s
piss-SUP
harro-i
whither-Q
'Hey, uncle, where are you going to?'
'[I am going] to piss'
In example (74), the supine is followed by a finite verb and thus the
final vowel of the supine suffix is dropped.
khat-e
go-nls
k'at-o:
go-1s.NPT
'I am going to piss.'
The allophony of other suffixes that show final vowel deletion, e.g.
the active participle <-pa> and the infinitive suffix <-ma> is treated in
the relevant chapters. The words /c¹uli/ ‘anger', /walili/ ‘lie', /ŋali/
'beauty' are anomalous in retaining the final vowel in non-final posi-
tion, e.g. c'uli-?a 'by [his] anger' and not *c'ul-?a. If, however, vowel
deletion would lead to a phonologically impossible sequence of stops,
then the vowel deletion rule is blocked. The noun kokpa ‘uncle', for
example, has the genitive kokpa-mi 'of the uncle', and not *kokp-mi.
3.1 Number
To the nominal categories belong the following parts of speech:
nouns, adjectives, pronouns and numerals. There are unambiguous
morphological criteria for distinguishing between nouns and verbs.
Whereas nouns can be marked for case and number, finite verbs are
marked for person, number, and tense. There is no grammatical gen-
der in Kulung.
75
The explicit non-singular suffix <-ci ~ -C -s> (ns) expresses the
non-singularity of both animate and inanimate objects. The basic al-
lomorph is <-ci>.
CHAPTER THREE
76
NOMINAL CATEGORIES
o:-kokpa
my-uncle
m-cha-ci
his-child-ns
'They are my uncle's children.'
Utterance (76) was said to the youngest of five puppies, which was
left without his four elder brothers, when these had been taken away
by a jackal:
ha:pi
where
am-bu-ci
k"at-a
yours-elder.brother-ns
go-PT
'Where have yours elder brothers gone?'
The non-singular suffix <-ci> is also used to denote a class. For ex-
ample, in the next sentence, the non-singular suffix <-ci> added after
tei 'cloth' is used to express 'kinds of clothes' rather than the plurality
of 'cloth'. Non-singularity is not an obligatory category in Kulung.
24
77
78
79
80
k"o:lo-mi-n
all-GEN-EMP
With proper nouns and kinship terms the non-singular suffix <-ci>
means: 'X and the people belonging to X'.
81
82
'We sew everybody's clothes.'
When the ablative <-ka> or the topicalising suffix <-kə> (TOP) is
added to non-singularised nouns ending in a vowel, the non-singular
morpheme <-ci> has an allomorph <-s>, except after a final /-s/ in the
preceding stem, e.g. (80).
yoŋc¹a-s-ka
