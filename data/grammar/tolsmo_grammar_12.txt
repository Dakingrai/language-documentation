This chapter is devoted to the general subordinating suffix <-kə>.
Depending on differences in syntactic scope, the suffix conveys
meanings that have been labelled in grammars of Kiranti languages as
nominaliser, relativiser and imperfective aspect marker. I will try to
show how the suffix is used in various constructions and what kind of
meaning can be attributed to the suffix in each type of construction.
With the subordinating suffix <-kə> smaller syntactic constituents
like adverbs, adverbial clauses, and adjectives are nominalised. For
example, the demonstrative pronouns that are used as a third person
singular pronoun are derived from the adverbs to: 'up', na: 'further',
and nu: 'down', respectively. With the subordinating suffix <-kə>,
these adverbs behave like nouns and take case endings.

SUBORDINATION
Similarly, the adverbial clause in sentence (397) has been nominalised
and fulfils the function of object of the verb nima 'to cook'.

Addition of the subordinating suffix <-kə> to a verbal clause turns the
verbal clause into a noun that can be the subject of the sentence as in
example (402), where the verbal clause 'you like it' has become the
subject of the main verb man-tu 'there is not".

examples (403- 406).

Most striking, however, is the addition of the subordinating suffix
<-kə> to an affirmative or negated simple verb, auxiliary, or infini-
tive. What, for example, is the difference between sentence (414) and
sentence (415)? Both are in the preterite tense and differ only in hav-
ing or lacking the subordinating suffix added to the finite verb. I have
tried to explain the difference in meaning in the English translation of
sentence (415).
samk¹e na-?a

kim-a
elder.sister-ERG give-1s.PT-SUB rot-PT
"The potatoes my elder sister gave me were rotten.'

'I came yesterday.'
Likewise, the difference between example (416) and example (417) is
a very subtle one.
u-i
to-ka
come: 1s.PT-SUB
espa
yesterday
'It so happens that I came yesterday.'
chui-a
what-Q_be-PT
'What has happened?'
u-i
chur-a-ka
what-Q be-PT-SUB
'What has happened?' (What is it that has happened?)
Sentences (418) and (419) show examples of the addition of the sub-
ordinating suffix <-kə> to an auxiliary and an infinitive, respectively.
Example (420) is an illustration of the subordinating suffix <-kə>
after a negated finite verb.
