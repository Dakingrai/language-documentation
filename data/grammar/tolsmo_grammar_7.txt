4.1 Conjugations
The different conjugations in Kulung are based on paradigmatically
conditioned stem alternations. The affixes of the intransitive, transi-
tive and reflexive paradigms are the same in all conjugations. Six in-
transitive, seven transitive and three reflexive conjugations can be
distinguished. Some of the auxilaries show irregular conjugations,
which are characterised by stem suppletion. The irregular transitive
verb ho:myema 'to leave', for example, has a suppletive stem <yem->
in the negated preterite forms. Stem alternations involve Ablaut or
stem-final consonant deletion or both. Full paradigms are given in
Appendix II. Verb stems (Σ) are numbered from 21 to 28.
4.2 Intransitive conjugations
4.2.1 The first conjugation (vi-1)
The first conjugation of the intransitive paradigm (vi-1) is character-
ised by one stem for all verb forms of the simplex paradigm. Verbs

with a 1 ending in one of the liquids (-r,-1, -m) belong to this conju-
gation.

4.2.2 The second conjugation (vi-2)
The second conjugation (vi-2), the most numerous conjugation, has
two different stems. The 2 is formed either by deletion of the stem-
final consonant or consonants and lengthening of the stem vowel or
by mutation of the stem-final consonant or consonants. This Σ2 oc-
curs only in the negative preterite forms and the infinitive and the
non-finite constructions which are derived from the infinitival stem.
The following synchronic rules show how the 2 can be derived from
the 1. A stem Σ1 ending in the fricative /-s/, preceded by either a
vowel or a liquid, i.e. stems ending in /-s/, /-ms/, /-ls/ or /-rs/, forms its
Σ2 by deletion of the stem-final fricative /-s/.

negated preterite forms and in 1s-2 forms. Synchronic rules for de-
riving 2 from El are presented below. A stem Σ1 ending in a liquid
followed by /s/ forms its 2 by elision of the /s/, e.g. /-rs/>/-r/, etc.

4.3.3 The third conjugation (vt-3)
The third transitive conjugation (vt-3) has three stems. The stem [2,
formed by deletion of the final dorso-velar stop with compensatory
vowel lengthening, appears in negated preterite forms and in 1s-2
forms. The Σ3, derived from the Σ1 by Ablaut of the stem vowel, is
found in negated preterite forms with a first person dual agent and a
third person patient, in forms with a first person dual patient, and in
negated preterite (3-3)ns forms.

4.3.4 The fourth conjugation (vt-4)
The fourth transitive conjugation (vt-4) has three different verb stems.
The 2, formed by the doubling of the final consonant of the 1,
occurs in 2s 3s non-preterite and affirmative preterite, 2s-3ns non-
preterite, 3s 3s non-preterite and affirmative preterite, and (3→→3)ns
non-preterite forms. The 3, occuring in all the forms of the negative
preterite and in all forms where a 1s-2 relation is expressed, can be
derived from the E1 by means of the following synchronic rules. First
of all, a stem El ending in /-s/ deletes the stem-final consonant.
