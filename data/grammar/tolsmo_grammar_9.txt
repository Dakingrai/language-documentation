The preterite negative prefix <man- ~ mam- ~ maŋ-> (NEG.PT) in pre-
fixal slot pfl indicates negation and preterite tense in all persons. This
morpheme has the following allomorphic distribution:
/man-/ →→→[man-] /d-, t-, t¹-, c-, c¹-, j-, n-, l-, r-, s-/
/man-/→→→[mam-] /b-, p-, p¹-, m-/
/man-/→→→[maŋ-] /g-, k-, k¹-, ŋ-, h-, w-, (?)V(:)-/
220
Besides indicating negation and preterite tense in all persons, the pre-
fix <man-> is found in the finite verb forms man-tu and man-chu
which mean 'is not' and 'should not' respectively. Moreover, the pre-
fix <man-> is the marker of negation for non-finite forms such as in-
finitives in <-ma>, active participles in <-pa>, and forms ending in
the negated simultaneous suffix <-mo> or sequential suffix <-na>.

The tense marker <-a> (PT) occurs in affirmative forms of the preter-
ite. The preterite tense marker <-a> is not found in verb forms in
66
which preterite tense is already indicated by a portemanteau mor-
pheme, e.g. the first plural preterite suffix (1p.PT) <-i>. The Kulung
tense system distinguishes between an unmarked non-preterite tense
and a marked preterite tense. Non-preterite tense is used for depicting
actions and events that take place at the moment of speech or in the
future, whereas preterite tense refers to past actions or events.

The non-first person singular morpheme <-e> (n1s), indicating a non-
first person, is an epenthetic suffix that is elided in most verb forms,
e.g. before the non-preterite negative suffix <-no>, the conditional
suffix <-do> and the reported speech suffix <-the>. The suffix differs
from other verbal affixes in that the non-first person singular mor-
pheme is found after the interrogative pronouns as-e ‘who is it?' and
u-i-e 'what is it?'.
'I am happy.'
