9.1 The perfect gerund
The suffix <-na> of the perfect gerund (PFG) is used to express an
event that is prior to the main clause event. The suffix can be added
after finite verbs, imperatives and infinitives. The same suffix with
identical meaning is the Bahing gerund <-na> attached after a verb
form (Hodgson 1880: 368). The suffix appears to be cognate with the
Classical Tibetan prolative particle <-nas>, which, attached to past
verbal stems, expresses temporal sequence and is translated as 'after
having...'. Chamling, a closely related Rãï language, uses the cognate
suffix <-n^>.

9.2 The present gerund
The suffix <-to> is added to a verb stem yielding a present gerund. A
present gerund (PRG) indicates that the situation denoted by the verb
is contemporaneous with the situation denoted by the finite verb of
the main clause.

9.3 The active participle
The active participle <-pa> (AP) is formed by attaching the morpheme
to the infinitive stem. The active participle has a regular allomorph
<-kpa> with verbs belonging to the conjugations vi-4 and vt-3, e.g.
pik-pa say-AP from the verb pima ‘to say’ or ŋok-pa ask-AP ‘beggar'
from the verb ŋo:ma vi-4 [1: ŋok- 2: ŋo:- 3: ŋok-] 'to ask'. The allo-
483
morph <-p> of the active participle is found in non-final position. The
active participle is negated by the negative preterite prefix <man->.

Furthermore, with the aid of the active participle adjectives can be
derived from qualitative verbs, e.g. lempa 'sweet' from the verb
lemma 'to be sweet', harpa 'dry' from the verb harma 'to be dry'. An
active participle can be found with case endings or in the non-singular
number. This use is found predominantly in embedded adnominal
clauses.

9.4 The passive participle
The passive participle (PP) is made by adding the suffix <-mpa> to the
infinitival stem. An allomorph <-pa> is found with infinitival stems
already ending in /-m/. The passive participle is used to make passive
forms from transitive and intransitive verbs. These may be used ad-
nominally as adjectives, or behave like nouns and therefore can be
found with case endings or in the non-singular number. The noun
t"ompa 'wall', for example, consists of the verbal stem t'o- from the
verb toma vt-8 'to bring up, build' and the passive participle suffix
<-mpa>.

9.5 The infinitive
The infinitive is formed by adding the infinitive suffix <-ma> to the
infinitival verb stem. The allomorphic distribution of the infinitive is
as follows. An allomorph <-m> occurs in sentence or clause non-final
position and the zero allomorph <Ø> is found after infinitival stems.
ending in the nasal /-m/, e.g. o:-im loi-e 'I am sleepy. (lit. 'My sleep-
ing feels.'). Negation of the infinitive is regularly made by prefixing
the negative preterite prefix <man-> or one of its allomorphs to the
verb stem, e.g. k'o:-ma 'to look at', maŋ-k"or-ma 'not to look at'.
When not governed by a finite form, the infinitive is used to express
'to want' and 'to have to'. The subject of the verb appears as a per-
sonal possessive prefix.
am-tu-ma
am-khai-ma
yo
yo
yours-be-INF or yours-go-INF or
'Do you want to stay or do you want to go?'
126
514

In this use, negation is expressed by adding the negative non-preterite
suffix <-no> immediately after the infinitive suffix.
516
517
518
or-che-ma
my-piss-INF
519

Secondly, the infinitive is found as an object of the verbs nəima ‘to
like', mima 'to think about', maima 'to forget' and yaima ‘to finish'.
