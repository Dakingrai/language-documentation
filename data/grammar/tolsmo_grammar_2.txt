ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
First of all I would like to thank Ratna Rām Rãî and his family for
the hospitality I enjoyed during my stays in Cheskām. Without
their help, the task of writing a grammar of Kulung would have
been a difficult one. Living with the Kulung in the beautiful hills
of Nepal was a moving and unforgettable experience. Furthermore,
I should like to thank Prof. Dr. George van Driem, who inspired.
me to go to Nepal and gave me a lot of support during each stage
of
my
research. Thanks go to Prof. Dr. Frederik Kortlandt and to
Prof. Dr. Robert Beekes, who also kindly read the manuscript and
gave me valuable suggestions. Research for this grammar was con-
ducted as part of the Himalayan Languages Project of Leiden Uni-
versity, a research programme supported by the Netherlands Orga-
nisation for Scientific Research (NWO) and other sponsors. Finally,
I would like to thank Brill Academic Publishers for accepting this
revised version of my dissertation in the series Languages of the
Greater Himalayan Region.

EDITORIAL FOREWORD
Gerard Tolsma is to be congratulated for this fundamental contri-
bution to linguistics and to the Kulung people. The Kulung communi-
ty in Nepal has long awaited the appearance of this grammar. Schol-
ars of the Kulung community even actively assisted in its completion.
In February 1998, Bhupa Dhoj Thomros and Yam Bahadur Kulung
sent to the author and the Himalayan Languages Project in Leiden a
meticulous thirty-page handwritten list of corrigenda, suggestions and
alternative analyses, based on an earlier draft of the present grammar.
Most emendations proposed by these Kulung scholars were incorpor-
ated by the author into the 1999 draft of the grammar. The contribu-
tion of the two Kulung scholars has been archived in Leiden for future
reference by Kiranti scholars together with a description of Kulung
rituals by Tolsma that is more detailed than the account provided in
this grammar.
Jean Robert Opgenort, author of the Wambule and Jero grammars
and the phonological reconstruction of Proto-Kiranti previously pub-
lished in this series, deserves much thanks for converting the entire
manuscript of this grammar into a properly formatted electronic docu-
ment with usable fonts after the work had been allowed to languish
after the author's Leiden doctoral defence in June 1999. A helpful list
of comments and corrigenda generously provided by Prof. Dr. Robert
Beekes in July 1999 also proved useful in preparing the present Brill
edition. The map and kinship diagrams were redrawn on the basis of a
copy of the dissertation used at the defence.

CHAPTER ONE
INTRODUCTION
1.1 The language
1.1.1 The Kulung language
Kulung is a Rãï language spoken by an estimated 15,000 people in
some ten villages along the upper reaches of the Hungu or Hongu
river (a tributary of the Dūdhkosī), in Solu Khumbu District of Sagar-
māthā Zone in eastern Nepal. Although the indigenous name for the
language is kuluriŋ, the term ‘Kulung' will be used throughout this
monograph since it is the name that is found in the literature. The
main Kulung-speaking villages are Chemsin and Cheskäm. The par-
ticular dialect of the language spoken in these two villages is con-
sidered by the Kulung to be the most original form of their language.
Downstream, on both sides of the Hungu river, in villages that are
now called Lucām, Gudel, Cacalun, Nãmlun, Pelmän, Bun, Chekmā,
and Sātdi, a less significant dialect of Kulung is spoken. Ethnic Ku-
lung living in the village of Sotan call their language sotto rin 'Sotān
language', but consider themselves to be Kulung and easily under-
stand the dialect of Kulung spoken in Chemsin and Cheskäm. In the
Gudel dialect, for example, the verb c'əmma ‘to dance' is used instead
of the regular verb sil bama, which is used in the Kulung dialect of
Cheskām and Chemsin. Another example is the word sela 'tomor-
row', which is used in all varieties of Kulung except in the dialect
spoken in Chemsin and Cheskäm, where the word desa is used. The
Kulung long vowel /u:/, which is realised as [yu] before the vowel /e/,
was further fronted in such environments in the Sotan dialect to merge
with the phoneme /i/, e.g. Kulung tu:-e [tyy-e] 'it is' is realised as
/ti:-e/ in the Sotān dialect. Likewise Kulung rum 'salt' has become
rim in the Sotãn dialect. Another feature of the Sotan dialect is secon-
2
dary vowel length as a result of consonant cluster reduction (Tolsma:
1999).
A few correspondences between Kulung and the Sotän dialect are
listed below.

CHAPTER ONE
Further downstream in the village Hulu, people refer to themselves
as nac'iriŋ, but their language may also be considered as a dialect of
Kulung. The oral tradition telling of the migration of the Kulung peo-
ple is supported by linguistic evidence. Migrations to other parts of
Nepal have taken place in recent years. In the village of Bālā in
Sankhuvā Sabha District, for example, there is a small population of
Kulung, who have retained their language despite the majority of the
population of that village being Mevähän. The Kulung have two Rãi
groups as neighbours, the Khaling and the Thulung, whom they call
k'al and t'ulu respectively. Representatives of other Nepalese ethnic
groups living in Cheskām are the two families of Kāmī, blacksmiths,
and the two families of Damãīm tailors. Whilst members of these
families speak Nepali as their native language, they are also essential-
ly fluent in Kulung. The two Kāmī families have been living in Ches-
kām for seven generations and still blame their forefathers for having
moved from the Kathmandu valley to this remote place. A few Sherpa
families, living in the neighbouring village of Māmerku, are fluent in
both Sherpa and Nepali as well as having a good command of Ku-
lung.
In the nineteenth century, a short vocabulary of Kulung, tran-
scribed as Kulúng 'ya, was written by Hodgson (1880: 176-193). The
Kulung words in this vocabulary are given in a form of transliteration
that is difficult to understand, although the language is certainly the
same as the language that is dealt with in this monograph. The Kulung
language is very briefly treated both in the third volume of the Lin-
guistic Survey of India (Grierson 1909) and in Wolfenden (1935). The
latter publication includes a short text in Kulung followed by some
grammatical remarks, thus providing a little more information on the
Kulung language.
In recent years, a Kulung vocabulary has been written by Kṛṣṇa
Prasād Rāī et al. (1975), containing Kulung words in Devanāgarī
script. This vocabulary contains many loan words from Nepali, and
much of the indigenous Kulung lexicon is absent. The same applies to
the dictionary recently written by Kṛṣṇabahādur Gānkhu Rãi (2049
VS), a native speaker of Kulung. The latter dictionary is full of neolo-
gisms which have been created by the author and are not part of the
indigenous Kulung lexicon. Another disadvantage of the dictionary is
that verbs are given in their infinitive without indicating the possible
verb stems and that vowel length is not consistently marked. Further
