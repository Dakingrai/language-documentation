Verb stems ending in /-u:/ [-uw] or /-m/ add the vowel /a/ before the
imperative suffix. Moreover, the verb pima vi-4 [1: pik- 2: pi:- 3:
pik-] 'to say' has an irregular imperative pika-wa 'say it!'.

11.2 The optative
The optative (OPT) is formed by addition of the optative suffix <-nu>
to verb form in the preterite tense, or before the imperative suffix. The
optative expresses the wish of the fulfilment of the situation denoted
by the verb.

11.3 The irrealis
The irrealis <-wa> (IRR) may be added to an affirmative or negated
verb in the preterite tense to express counterfactual or hypothetical
situations. If the irrealis particle <-wa> precedes the conditional suffix
<-do>, the irrealis particle <-wa> must also occur in the apodosis.

Particles are monosyllabic morphemes that can be attached to all the
different parts of speech and add a semantic nuance to a word or 
sen-
tence. The discourse particles below are frequent in everyday usage.
598
12.1 Question particles
Of the three question particles <-ko>, <-yo> and <-?o>, the question
particle <-yo> is the most used. Addition of this question particle
converts the sentence into a yes-or-no question. Affirmation can 
be
expressed by e 'yes' and negation by ma 'no'. Besides using a 
ques-
tion particle, it is perhaps far more common to answer with a 
finite
affirmative or negated form.

12.2 The topic particle <-kə>
The topic particle <-ka> (TOP) may be attached to nouns, pronouns,
adjectives and adverbs to topicalise the word the topic particle is at-
tached to. Topicalising a word means making the word the theme of
the sentence. Example (619) is asked to the youngest of five puppies,
whose four elder brothers had been taken away by a jackal. In the sen-
tence the four elder brothers are made the theme of the sentence: 'As
for your elder brothers, who has taken them away?'

to sit.

where sit-1s.NPT
'Where shall I sit.'
khaiy-u

In examples (621) and (622), the topicalising suffix highlights the per-
sonal pronoun to which the suffix <-kə> is attached.
