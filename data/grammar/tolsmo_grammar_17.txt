12.3 The contrastive particle <-ne>
The contrastive particle <-ne> (CTR) has contrastive and adversative
meaning. The contrastive particle <-ne> has a semantic scope that
largely corresponds to the Nepalese particle ta. The contrastive parti-
cle <-ne> is the same as the Khaling ‘emphatic' particle <ne> (cf.
Toba 1979: 37) and the Dumi 'prosodic particle' <ne> (van Driem
1993a: 401). The particle has an allomorph <-n> after words ending
in a vowel. The contrastive particle <-ne> can be added after nouns,
personal pronouns, and adverbs.

The contrastive meaning can be aptly illustrated by example (630).
This scenario takes places in a household where the occupants are
preparing tea in the afternoon. Having boiled the water, they added
tea leaves and drank the tea without sugar. That did not taste very
good, but after sugar was added to the tea, the lady said the following.

12.4 The emphatic particle <-na>
The emphatic particle <-ŋa> (EMP) is the semantic equivalent of the
particle nai in Nepali. The emphatic particle <-ŋa> has an allophone
<-> after words ending in a vowel. Added to case endings and
nouns, the emphatic particle <-na> expresses a meaning comparable
to that expressed by English 'the very'. The empahtic particle can also
modify adverbs and verb forms.

12.5 The affirmative particle <-ha>
The affirmative particle <-ha> (AFF) expects an affirmative answer a
'yes' to a question. The implication therefore is that thes speaker feels
quite certain of the information conveyed by the sentence. In sentence
(645), the speaker left home early in the morning promising to come
back in just a few minutes to prepare my breakfast. Eventually, he
came back late in the afternoon and asked.

12.8 The reported speech particle <-t¹e>
The reported speech particle <-t¹e> indicates that the information con-

reported speech with the particle <-re>, Kulung does not use the re-
ported speech particle <-the> when a person recounts his dreams.

12.9 The emotion particle <-i>
The particle <-i> (EMO) imbues a word or sentence with additional
emotion. The emotions that can be found with this particle may vary
from anger, e.g. (672), or despair, e.g. (673), (674), to surprise, e.g.
(675), (676). When, as in example (672), the daughter has been look-
ing for something but could not find it, the mother angrily shouts.
