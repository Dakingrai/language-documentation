use and meaning of the suffix. The situation in which sentence (422)

As a general rule, transitive verbs have agents in the ergative case and
take transitive verbal endings. In a number of Kulung verbs, the tran-
sitive counterpart of an intransitive verb shows the same verb stems.
For example the verb poma 'to wake up', which also happens to be
both transitive and intransitive in English, has the same three verb
stems [1: pak 2: po:- 3: pok-] in both the transitive and intransitive
paradigm in Kulung. In forms where there is no difference between
the transitive and intransitive verbal ending, ambiguity arises if no use
is made of the personal pronoun. Therefore the transitive and intransi-
tive forms of the verb po:ma 'to wake up' in examples (439) and
(440) are ambiguous if not preceded by the personal pronoun an ‘yous
(abs)' and ana ‘yous (erg)' respectively.

In some pairs of verb, the transitive counterpart belongs to a different
conjugation, e.g. the intransitive verb cima 'to be wet' belongs to the
conjugation vi-2 and has two different verb stems: [1: ci:-2: ci-].
442
443
The transitive counterpart of this verb is cima 'to make wet', which
belongs to the fourth conjugation vt-4 with three different verb stems
[1: ci- 2: ciry- 3: ci-].

Likewise, t'alma vi-1 [1: tal-] 'to be stirred with a ladle (of stuff that
is being boiled)' differs from its transitive counterpart t"əlma vt-4 [1:

Intransitive verbs that do not have a transitive counterpart may form
the corresponding transitive verb with the aid of the productive causa-
tiviser mima 'to cause', e.g. kerma vi-2 [1: keŋ- 2: ke:-] 'to become
cold, cool off has as transitive counterpart ke: mima 'to cool, to cause
to become cold'. Four verbs show transitive endings with a noun in
the absolutive case. Since the difference between transitivity and in-
transitivity in languages can only be defined in morphosyntactic
446
terms, these verbs are classified as transitive verbs. A possible expla-
nation is that these verbs are constructed with an unexpressed agent, a
supernatural force, for example. The nouns in the absolutive are then
considered as the patients of these verbs.

8.1 Improductive causatives: reflexes of Tibeto-Burman *<-t> direct-
ive suffix
A PTB suffix *<-t> with 'directive' meaning has been reconstructed
by Benedict (1972: 97-103), and the reflexes of this suffix are found
in Kiranti languages. In Kulung, only five examples are found which
114
can be said to show a reflex of the PTB *<-t> 'directive'. Below the
five examples are listed; the verb without the reflex of the 'directive'
suffix is presented with the corresponding verb with the reflex of the
'directive' suffix below. Four of these verb pairs denote motion.

8.2 Improductive causatives: reflexes of Tibeto-Burman *<-s> cau-
sative suffix
'to like'
Reflexes of the PTB *<-s> suffix with 'causative' meaning are also
found in Kulung. Interestingly, Kulung shows the reflexes of both the
'directive' and 'causative' suffix, whereas in other Kiranti languages
only one of the two is found. Verbs with the *<-s> suffix all have
causative meaning. Three clear examples are found.
'to get up'
'to bear'

8.3 The productive causativiser
The verb mima vt-4 [1: mi:- 2: mi:y- 3: mi-] ‘to cause to' serves as the
productive causativiser. From the intransitive verb harma vi-1 [1:.
har-] 'to be dry', for example, a causative verb harmima 'to dry' is
derived. Almost every verb can be found with the productive causa-
tiviser. Examples are the following: gema 'to laugh', gemima 'to
make laugh', k'urma ‘to carry', k'urmima ‘to cause to carry', du:ma
'to drink', durmima ‘to cause to drink'.
