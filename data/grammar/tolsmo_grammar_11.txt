CHAPTER SIX
Compound verbs are verbal constructions in which a first verb stem
(V1) is followed by a second verb stem (V2), that semantically modi-
fies the first verb stem. The second verb stem with its verbal affixes
will be referred to as an auxiliary. The semantic range of the auxilia-
ries varies from deictic categories like 'upward' and 'downward' to
aspect-like notions such as 'telic', 'durative', 'perseverative', etc. The
third person preterite of the verb k'amma 'to weep' is k'ap-a. This
form can be constructed as a compound verb by adding the stem bok-
of the inceptive auxiliary -boma immediately after the E1 of the V1.
k"ap-bok-a
weep-INC-PT
COMPOUND VERBS
'He started to cry.'
Compound verbs are found in many South Asian languages, whether
the language belongs to the Tibeto-Burman, Austroasiatic, Dravidian
or Indo-European language family. George van Driem (1987, 1993)
introduced the term aspectivisers. Although the latter term is very apt
because auxilaries express Aktionsart, the more neutral cover term
auxiliary is simply used in this grammar. The V1 of a compound verb
is, in most instances, the base stem (1) of a simple verb. Syntactic-
ally compound verbs behave like simple verbs, i.e. they can appear in
the infinitive or imperative, and active and passive participles can also
be constructed as compound verbs. Morphologically there are a few
peculiarities: The first person singular and plural, for example, attach
their verbal endings to both the stem of the simple verb and to the
monosyllabic second part. Moreover, verbal endings attached to the
simple verb stem are marked for preterite tense.

Stem suppletion is found in the paradigm of some auxilaries. For ex-
ample, the momentaneous auxiliary <dit-> has a first singular preter-
ite form to instead of the expected *dit-u. These irregular conjuga-
tions are labeled vi-irr and vt-irr. Their full paradigms can be found in
Appendix II.

6.1 The telic auxiliary kama
The telic auxiliary khama, having an irregular conjugation, augments
both transitive and intransitive verbs. The telic auxiliary stresses com-
pletion of the action expressed by the verb. Example (315) contrasts
with example (316) in that (315) means that someone lifts something
up and remains at that spot, whereas the form with the auxiliary ex-
presses telicity, giving the meaning 'to carry it home'.

The verb limma ‘to set (of the sun)' is obligatorily constructed with
the telic auxiliary k'ama, the sentence *nam lipp-a being considered
to be ungrammatical.

The auxiliaries bo:ma vi-4 [1: bok- 2: bo:- 3: bok-] and vt-3 [1: bok- 2:

main verb. The label for this auxiliary is INC.

6.3 The momentaneous auxiliary dima
The momentaneous auxiliary (MOM) indicates that the action express-
ed by the verb only lasts for a short period or that the action expressed
by the verb will take place immediately. Both meanings are closely
connected and can be adequate labelled 'momentaneous', expressing
both short duration and immediacy. The momentaneous auxiliary has
an irregular conjugation that can be found in Appendix II. Example
(328), where the pushing only lasted for a short period, is an example
of an auxiliary with momentaneous Aktionsart.

6.4 The intermediate action auxiliary do:ma
Addition of the intermediate action auxiliary do:ma vi-2 [1: doŋ- 2:
do:-] and vt-4 [1: doŋ- 2: donn- 3: do:-] conveys the meaning of ante-
riority of the V1 with respect to an other verb that may or may not be
expressed.

6.5 The continuous auxiliary cama
The continuous auxiliary cama expresses continuity of the action de-
noted by the verb to which the auxiliary is attached. The continuous
auxiliary may occur with both transitive and intransitive verbs. When
used with intransitive verbs, the auxiliary belongs to conjugation vi-6
and when used with transitive verbs, the auxiliary is identical with the
verb cama vt-7 ‘to eat'. In the intransitive form of the non-first singu-
lar non-preterite, the epenthetic non-first singular morpheme <-e> is
dropped.

6.6 The durative auxiliary yu:ma
The durative auxiliary yu:ma vt-2 [1: yuks- 2: yur-] expresses the dura-
tion of the activity of the verb. The auxiliary is identical with the sim-
plex verb yurma vt-2 [1: yuks- 2: yu:-] meaning ‘to put'. In the para-
digm of the durative auxiliary, the main verb and the auxiliary are
partially amalgamated. A full paradigm of the durative auxiliary can
be found in Appendix II.

6.7 The perseverative auxiliary lama
Like the durative auxiliary, the perseverative auxiliary lama expresses
duration. The duration expressed by the perseverative auxiliary is
longer and more persistent than the duration expressed by the durative
auxiliary. Some perseverative compounds have meanings that have
become lexicalised. For example, addition of the perseverative auxil-
iary to the simplex verb tuma 'to be, to sit' gives the verb tumlama ‘to
spend the night, stay over for the night'. The perseverative auxiliary
lama has an irregular conjugation, which can be found in Appendix II.
