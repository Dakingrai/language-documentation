publications on Kulung include a short treatise on Kulung phonology
by Andreas Holzhausen (1973) and a short paper on Kulung clauses
by his wife Anna Holzhausen (1973).
1.1.2 The Kiranti languages
Together with Limbu, the Rãi languages belong to the Kiranti branch
of the Tibeto-Burman language family. The Kiranti languages are
characterised by their elaborate system of verbal endings, which are
said to have been the result of a historical process traditionally called
'complex pronominalisation', i.e. the incorporation of personal pro-
nouns into the verbal chain.
Bauman (1975), however, argues for the reconstruction of verbal
morphology at a Proto-Tibeto-Burman level, rather than for the incor-
poration of pronouns into the verbal system. George van Driem
(1990, 1993c) has further developed this hypothesis, and more recent
publications describing Tibeto-Burman languages would seem to con-
firm the reconstruction of verbal morphology at the Proto-Tibeto-
Burman level.
The Kiranti languages are also characterised by their archaic pho-
nologies. Phonological systems of modern Kiranti languages often
resemble reconstructed Old Chinese, without tones and with distinc-
tive vowel length (Baxter 1992, 1995), far more than the innovative
phonological systems of present-day Lolo-Burmese languages do,
with their complex tonal systems. Kulung is classified by van Driem
(2001: 698) as a Central Kiranti language.
1.2 The people
The Kulung are a people of Mongoloid stock practising sedentary
agriculture and animal husbandry. The major crops are potatoes,
maize and especially millet, from which a hard, thick brown paste,
called yuwa, is prepared and which forms the mainstay of the diet.
Rice is not cultivated by the Kulung. The millet paste is supplemented
with khai 'cooked vegetables' or ground soybeans. Meat is usually
only eaten on ritual occasions. Pork, boksa, is preferred to other meat,
a preference that is shared by many other Tibeto-Burman peoples. As
with some other Rãi peoples, the eating of goat meat is forbidden. The

CHAPTER ONE
Kulung are proud of drinking a lot of alcohol. In their eating and
drinking habits, the Kulung are quite different from the higher caste
Hindus in Nepal, who do not drink any alcohol and who eat castrated
goat in preference to other meat. Lower castes living in Kulung vil-
lages, such as Kämī blacksmiths and the Damäïm tailors, have largely
adopted the Kulung way of life in as much as they drink alcohol and
eat pork.
1.2.1 Clans
According to the oral tradition of the Kulung, their ancestor, k"əp, had
two sons, chemsi and tamsi. As a result, Kulung society is divided into
two lineages; one descending from chemsi, and the other from the
offspring of tamsi. In the village of Chemsin, the majority of clans
belong to the chemsi lineage, while in villages further downstream,
clans descending from the c"emsi lineage tend to be in the minority.
The major clans of the the chemsi lineage are tomoc"a, walak"am,
wadiri and moro:ku, while the dominant clans deriving descent from
the tamsi lineage are rinho, mant"erbu and honelu.
Every clan has a secret name, dapsniŋ, in the ritual language of the
Kulung, which is known as sak"umbu. The secret names of the clans
are used during the recitation of ritual texts by the shaman at wedding
ceremonies to welcome and honour participants. The secret names of
the important tomoc"a clan is sambelutupsima titilumolema.
1.2.2 Mythology
The mythological stories told by the Kulung concerning the origin of
the world and about their ancestors are part of the common Rãi my-
thology. In his anthropological study (1991), Martin Gaenszle de-
scribed how Kiranti mythology is interwoven with the kinship system.
Kulung equivalents of the common Rãî names of gods and heroes are
given in Table 2.
According to the Kulung people, their ancestors settled in the Hun-
gu valley some thirty-five generations ago. The Kulung elders told me
that their ancestors came from the Tarãî. When the Kulung ancestors
settled in the Hungu valley, they waged war against the local people
who were savages, referred to as rupiyoŋcha or co:dos by the Kulung.

The story about how the rupiyoŋc"a were defeated by the Kulung is
well-described by McDougal (1979: 17-19). The rupiyoncha however,
are called rungsiupa by McDougal, and the ladder by which the
rupiyoncha tried to escape to the sun was made from buckwheat ac-
cording to my informants and not from millet, as it is in McDougal's
account. Apart from the story, which is quite humorous in parts, the
date of the first settlement of the Kulung in the Hungu valley and the
identification of the Nepal lowlands as their place of origin may not
be entirely fictitious. Equally interesting in this respect is the fact that
Nepalis are nowadays referred to as t'aru in the Kulung language, and
that thāru in Nepali is the name of an Indo-Aryan people living along
the length and breadth of the Tarai.

Rites in Kulung society are always performed by a shaman, priest or
elder, who chants ritual texts in the ritual language. This ritual lan-
guage is used in the same way as Sanskrit is used in contemporary
Hindu rituals. In briefly describing the main rituals performed at the
time of my visits in Cheskām, I hope to give the reader some idea of
how these rituals are performed. Further details and a discussion of
the actual rituals can be found in MacDougal (1979) and in Gaenszle
(1991). Some words from the Kulung ritual language are given below,
along with their corresponding Kulung and English meanings.
During the tos ritual, which is performed three times a year, the
deceased relatives of the Kulung are called upon to promote the
growth of crops. The names of the three tos rituals are yenamtos, per-
formed in June, t'o:tos, which is held in September, and yautos, which
8
takes places in March. People gather on a hill in the village, beating
cymbals and blowing horns. The priest, who is called a nokc"o, pours
ritual millet beer on a stone that is placed in a hole in the ground.
People dance around the hole playing cymbals. After a while, the
priest also starts to dance. The purpose of the beating of the cymbals
and the blowing of horns is to invoke the ancestors. After the ritual is
finished, the Kulung drink wheat beer during yenamtos, maize beer
during tho:tos, and millet beer at yautos. The ritual is performed twice,
once at the foot of the hill for the descendants of chemsi, and once on
top of the hill for the descendants of tamsi.

Another ritual of particular importance is the nagi ritual The ritual
is named after nagi, a pan-Rãi god who is visualised as a water ser-
pent and who lives in the river. The deity nagi is said to live in the
mountains during the summer, and in the valleys during winter. When
nagi is in the valley, extra care must be taken not to offend nagi in
any way.
Important occasions in the life of the members of a household are
celebrated with a ritual that is performed by a mo:bocha 'shaman'.
During this ritual, called a mo:bo, a pig or a chicken is sacrificed. An
altar is usually present at this ritual, in the form of a house made of
leaves and branches, where various ritual artifacts are placed, such as
small ships made of leaves.

Household gods are worshipped in a ritual called daplo kuima. The
name of the ritual is based on the words daplo 'hearth' and kuima ‘to
libate', referring to the main event of the ceremony in which a shaman
libates the three hearth stones with millet beer. The three hearth
stones are called pak"alun, sambelun and mak"olun. The ritual cere-
mony is attended by all the members of the household along with
their close relatives.
1.3 The grammar
The present grammar is based on research conducted in the village of
Cheskām, which, with an estimated population of 3,000, is one of the
larger Kulung villages. An initial short visit in October 1992 was fol-
lowed by longer stays in the summer of 1993 and spring of 1994. A
final visit was made in November 1995. During my stays at Cheskām,
I had the pleasure of being the live-in guest of Ratna Rām Rai (born
1967 AD), his wife Mainā Maņī (born 1968 AD), and their two
daughters Durgā Māyā (born 1987 AD) and Śukre Māyā (born 1990
AD). Many of the examples in the grammar are taken from their con-
versations and form the basis for my understanding of the Kulung
language. Words are given in a transcription which uses the symbols
of the International Phonetic Association (IPA 1993). The transcrip-
tion is phonological, but words that are subject to final vowel deletion
(see 2.4.2) are given in their phonetic representation.

i.e. height, backness, rounding and length. There are six short vowels
