The imperative
Imperatives in Kulung are made with the aid of one of the suffixes -wǝ, -te or -kʰoŋ. Of these imperative suffixes, the suffix -wǝ is slightly more polite than the suffix -te. The imperative suffix -kʰoŋ differs from the suffixes -wǝ and -te, in that the imperative suffix -kʰoŋ is used to express additional impatience and the desired immediate realisation of the order issued.
Verb stems ending in -u: [-uw] or -m add the vowel a before the imperative suffix. Moreover, the verb pi:ma vi-4 [1: pik- 2: pi:- 3: pik-] 'to say' has an irregular imperative pika-wǝ 'say it!'.
The negated forms of the imperative are formed by addition of the imperative endings after the negation marker for imperatives -nǝ.

The optative
The optative (OPT) is formed by addition of the optative suffix -nu to verb form in the preterite tense, or before the imperative suffix. The
optative expresses the wish of the fulfilment of the situation denoted by the verb.

The irrealis
The irrealis -wa (IRR) may be added to an affirmative or negated verb in the preterite tense to express counterfactual or hypothetical
situations. If the irrealis particle -wa precedes the conditional suffix -do, the irrealis particle -wa must also occur in the apodosis.
